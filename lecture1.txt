Rational Agent 
    - A rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performace 

Task Envirnment 
    - The set of parameters that define the agent's task 
    Broken down into 4 parts:
        - Performace measure: what are we trying to achieve?
        - Envirnment: what things in the world do we 
        - Actuators: 
        - Sensors: What can we perceive?
    Example: Robot Vacuum
        -Performace measure: removes dirt, operate quicky, cover sufficient area
        -Envirnment: Room, furniture dirt, other obstacles
        -Actuators: Wheels, Vacuum
        -Sensore: Bumb sensore, cleanliness sensor

    Types of Task Envirnments
        - Full obserable vs partically observable: can the agenet see the full state of the envirnment at all times
        - Single agent vs multi agent: are there other agents we need to consider while doing the task 
        - Cooperative vs competitive: if there are other agents, are they helping our agent or hindering it completing its job
        
        - Discrete vs continous: can we break up time into discrete time steps
        - Known vs unknown: how well does the agent understand the rules of how the envirnment works?
